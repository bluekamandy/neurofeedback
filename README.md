## Introduction 

Neurofeedback is a form of ***biofeedback***. This is the process of enabling people to experience a visual or auditory representation of readings from their body for the purpose of developing the skill to control them. In general, biofeedback can be done using "skin temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, brain waives, and other body conditions." ([Source](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-resilient-brain/201410/what-is-neurofeedback)) Neurofeedback specifically targets the brain waives, enabling patients to experience a visual or auditory representation of their brain waives.

***Oscillopathies*** are abnormal oscillatory brain activities. These can include "epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia,  anxiety/trauma-related disorders, major depressive disorders, addiction."

Electroencephalography (EEG) has existed since 1924. It was invented by German Psychiatrist Hans Berger. ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Berger))
